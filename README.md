## Ant Facts!

Install packages with `Yarn`

Start with `Yarn Start`

Because the Fake Facts can be a bit hit or miss, I included some options in the .env file:

- FAKE_FACT_OVERRIDE - Let's you use your own fake fact

- FAKE_FACT_TAKE - Determines which fake fact is taken when using the API

Make sure you take note of the fake fact and don't accidentally reveal it too early when you copy the terminal output!
